          "P1": "I was born in the city of Chapecó, in the west of the state of Santa Catarina, on October 16, 2004, at Unimed Chapecó Hospital, between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m.",
          "P2": "From the moment I was about to come into the world, life told me to be different. I took that literally and ended up being born \"twice\"...",
          "P3": "Well, I was supposed to be born through natural delivery, but I wanted to be a bit too different and ended up being born with my feet where my head should be... Yeah, I’m not kidding.",
          "P4": "The result was that the natural delivery had to be stopped and they resorted to a C-section. So maybe, if I hadn’t been so mischievous, I would have been born on the 15th. Crazy, right?",
          "P5": "When I was little, I was always a stressed and impulsive child. I caused some trouble, but I also had the privilege of being the only grandchild until I was four years old...",
          "P6": "My personality gradually shaped into that of a more introspective and reserved young person. I often talked to myself (I still do to this day). I’m part of Generation Z, who grew up watching Dragon Ball, Super Eleven, and Naruto on rental DVDs... and I even had the chance to see the world before the big tech boom.",
          "P7": "In my teenage years, I found refuge in video games and anime. Bands like Linkin Park and Bring Me The Horizon marked my life, as well as anime such as Attack On Titan, Naruto Shippuden, Fairy Tail, JoJo, Black Clover, and One Piece. Games like Fortnite, Rainbow Six, League of Legends, Skyrim, and other open-world titles also left their mark.",
          "P8": "Today, all of this is more of a weekend hobby, but I still believe it’s never \"just a game\" or \"just a cartoon\" — there’s always something to learn from these stories."

      "EDUCATION": {
        "TITLE": "Education",
        "CONTENT": {
          "P1": "I graduated from high school at EEB Marechal Bormann, a school where I met friends I’ll carry with me for life and for which I have great affection. During my third year of high school, I had my first contact with the world of programming by participating in Entra21, a program by Blusoft, a company from Blumenau, in partnership with Fapesc, held at Senac in Chapecó. It was 6 months of learning and gaining knowledge in programming. Honestly, I was very scared. Imagine being a 17-year-old who still didn’t know what he wanted in life, suddenly faced with OOP, databases, web protocols... Oh my God! There were classes where the teacher made jokes about me because I would fall asleep in the back of the classroom. At the beginning, it’s like that, I think it’s hard not to be.",
          "P2": "After those 6 months, I finished high school along with the course and immediately started studying Computer Science at university. Even though I was still very afraid of the field, I felt confident that this was what I wanted for my life, because the challenges are many, unlimited, \"never enough,\" so to speak... But that intrigued me, because there’s always something new to learn. For someone who started working in a supermarket at the age of 14, it’s better than nothing, right?",
          "P3": "At the same time I entered college, I started a software development internship at Infogen Sistemas, a company that helped me a lot with knowledge I’ll always carry with me. It was a year of hands-on experience, learning not only how to develop software, but also creativity, systemic vision, and critical thinking. Today, I continue taking courses to further improve my knowledge of what I already know and to learn new things. That’s what hooked me into this field: with each step, with each new piece of knowledge, you become a new version of yourself — you don’t remain in the \"same old sameness.\" And today I keep moving forward for more.",
          "P4": "Oh, and I almost forgot, but I’m also proficient in English. I don’t like to say fluent, because, in my view, true fluency borders on being a native speaker. Just like programming, it always needs to be practiced. Anyway... I studied for nine years at Wizard by Pearson in Chapecó, a school that also has a place in my heart, with a great teaching methodology. I completed all levels in 2022, continuously improving my conversation, reading, and writing skills. Today, to keep learning constantly, I mainly practice through music and reading. In the near future, I plan to study more languages — knowledge fascinates me."
